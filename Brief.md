## Introduction 

In industry it is common to work in a big team on a project. Moreover, the big team is divided up into smaller teams working on different aspects of the project. This coursework is designed to prepare you for this experience.   

You are required to conceive, design, implement and operate a project, as discussed in class, of your choice using a range of hardware provided to you by the University of Greenwich: 

## Hardware 

- Single Board Computers 
  - Raspberry Pis/Jetson Nanos/Odriod/Rock/ASUS... 
- Robotic Arms 
- Robotic Vehicle  
- Flick (e-field) 
- Webcams 
- Touchscreen 
- Azure development kit
- Range of sensors and actuators  
- And others (TB(D/C))

## Software

- Languages 
  - Python 
  - Shell 
  - C/C++/ C#
  - and any others you see fit 
- Git 
- Github 
- Gitkraken 


You will work as one team to conceive a scenario that the components provided to you can compliment.   

In this initial stage you will nominate a project manager to oversee the entire project and be responsible for initialising the GitHub repository through which you will all contribute through. 

The team will be broken down into sub teams whose tasks will be to develop a specific part of the project. All the sub parts should work together in the finished project.  

All code and documentation must be added to the Github repository, and the Github repository should have a sufficient number of branches for project development and subsequent merges to the ‘main’ branch as the project develops. 

A video viva presentation must be delivered that includes; a suitable logo, development of the project and final working demonstration. The format of the video should follow the flow of an engineering report: introduction, problem analysis, problem solution, results, discussion and conclusion.  

Video must be uploaded to private channel YouTube and shared via link using the **[Coursework Submission Document](https://moodlecurrent.gre.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2526729)**
